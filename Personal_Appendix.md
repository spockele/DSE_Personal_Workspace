# Expectations
* This is the first time that I will be working on a single project at a time. I expect there to be
 more work than any other project. However, I also think this will be highly advantageous, since
 we don't have to switch between different subjects all the time.\
* Since this is an open-ended project, I really expect this to be an enjoyable project. We can
 focus on what we want to do. This might pose a personal challenge for me, since I like having a
 well set out plan up front. I hope however that the first week of planning will
 resolve this issue.\
* During other projects, my teams would usually not have a person to take the lead. This would
 trigger me to take the role of team leader, even though this is not a job I particularly enjoy
 doing. I have the expectation that due to this being the only project, other, more capable
 leaders will emerge.

# Learning Objectives
* Since I got used to having to take the lead in projects, I want to learn to actually work in 
 a non-leading role for a change. This mainly involves learning to not pull the trigger on 
 final decisions and not overstepping someone else's leadership.\
* Another learning goal of mine is to actually learn how to apply systems engineering elements in
 an actual project. It used to be very theoretical during the systems engineering courses, so
 getting some practical experience is a personal objective of mine.\
* Since this project will be in a hybrid between working from home and from 'office', this is a
 great opportunity to learn how to work in this type of setting, instead of working only in person.
* Since verification and validation is a part of the process, I want to learn how to properly apply this.
 I have not yet had a good experience with this aspect of design. I want to work on aerodynamics,
 so this would be a good opportunity to try and achieve this.
