* Manufacturing:
    * Low importance, since early stage of design. 
    * Have to keep in mind the processes to avoid problems in future design stages.
    
* Structures
    * Without a structure there are no flying systems.
    * Very driving discipline that determines a lot of the other design aspects.
    
* Aerodynamics
    * The deployable nature of the system, makes aerodynamic design less relevant. Mostly analysis will be required to tie in with performance.
    
* Stability and control
    * For any flying system, stability and control is important to consider to ensure safety.
    * Control is especially important, since the system will be used by non-pilots
    
* Performance
    * There are many performance user requirements, thus a lot of time should be allocated to ensure the performance of the system.
    * Determines many other aspects of the design to fit into the need for performance.
    
* Propulsion
    * Due to the VTOL nature of the system, propulsion will be very important to ensure this function.
    
* Design integration and systems engineering
    * Important part of the design process, since a design cannot work without proper integration of all subsystems.
    * All team members will be involved in parts of the systems engineering work.
    * Systems engineering requires a lot of thought, specially in the beginning of the design process.
    
* Remote sensing
    * In the safety aspects of the system, a lot of focus should be on constant evaluation of the system's health.
    * The system will be used by non-pilot users, thus faults should be detected by a different means than visual inspection.
    
* Operations
    * Since this is a new type of product, thinking of operations is very important for both safety and to work out the novelties in operating this type of system.
    * Due to the non-pilot users, the system should have easy operation to ensure safety.

* Sustainability engineering:
    * Very relevant in these times. Need to become more sustainable society to ensure future for humanity.
    * Has to be paid attention to in every stage of the process and in every subsystem design.
